Demoblaze Security & Functional Testing Project

Preview

I created this project as a demonstration of my skills in software testing. I want to emphasize that my main goal is not to criticize the developers or degrade the quality of the product, but to showcase my grip, professionalism, and potential as a tester. I understand that some checks may seem absurd or unlikely in real life, but in testing, it is important not only to verify functionality but also to look for vulnerabilities where they are not expected.

Conclusion

This project demonstrated that even on a demo version of the site, critical vulnerabilities can be found. However, the primary goal was not to discredit the platform but to show what I can achieve as a Junior QA Engineer. I am confident that with every project, I will improve and grow in the field of testing alongside a team of like-minded people.
